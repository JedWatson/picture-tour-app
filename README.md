# React Hot Reloading Template

React.js Cordova / PhoneGap Template with Babel, Webpack and Hot Reloading

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this template, you'll need Node.js v4 or newer.

### Installation

To use this as a template, use Cordova 6.0.0+ and create a new project:

```
cordova create MyAppName --template=phonegap-template-react-hmr
```

```
cd MyAppName
```

```
npm install
```

### Run the app in the browser / simulator

Run this to start the development webpack server:

```
npm start
```

You can then open the app in your browser by visiting [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Open it in the iOS Simulator by running (in another terminal):

```
npm run ios
```

Or in the Android emulator with:

```
npm run android
```

(both of which are just calling `cordova run ios` and `cordova run android`)

In this mode, the app will live-reload changes to React components using [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) and CSS changes using the Webpack CSS loader.

### Build the app for production

To build the app without the development hot module reloading server:

```
npm run build [ -- ios || android]
```

i.e.:

```
npm run prepare -- ios
npm run prepare -- android
```

This will switch your `config.xml` file to production mode, build the app bundle to `/www` using Webpack, and run `cordova build` for you.

After that, the normal Cordova / PhoneGap commands can be used such as `phonegap serve`, or `cordova run ios`, etc.
